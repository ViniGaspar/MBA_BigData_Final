# MBA_BigData_Final
Final work on BigData from Mba softwate engineering at UFRJ



An application for android device was created in which it takes the user's latitude and longitude and creates a database that exports a .json file.
Based on the data, we use spark to read the file.
After reading the file, we were able to calculate the distance traveled by the user based on his coordinates.
